		Like any ancient literature, the <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> texts collected in the Tipiṭaka offer an eclectic field for research providing all kinds of historical, geographical, social and spiritual information for any scholar. Someone on a spiritual quest encounters through the words of the Buddha a source of inspiration, encouragement, learning and knowledge. Anyone who desires to apply and follow the path laid out by the Enlightened One obtains a storehouse of well-defined and practical guidance, detailed explanations and unblemished fundamental truths.

		This collection of <a href="#section1-note-1" class="notes-ipg" id="section1-note-1-rtn">texts<sup class="sup-spacing-ipg">1</sup></a> is entitled <span class="italic-w-ipg">‘Exploring the sacred, ancient path in the original words of the Buddha’</span> because it to offer the reader and the follower of the Buddha’s teaching a helpful survey and supportive resource for general, feasible application of the <a href="#section1-note-2" class="notes-ipg" id="section1-note-2-rtn">teaching<sup class="sup-spacing-ipg">2</sup></a>. The first chapters express the gratitude that one fosters when realising the rare and fortunate opportunity to encounter such a unique path at all, especially and even in our modern times. Once this path is applied and its beneficial results manifest themselves, naturally boundless gratitude arises towards those who endeavoured their own realization through this path. They still present themselves to us as an inspiring example of earnestness, persistence and determination.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph-1-ipg">
		The main chapters attempt to depict the path at its fundamental core. It is a universal path that can be accepted and applied by each and every one irrespective of age and gender, race and faith. It is a path that is well explained, thoroughly described and leading to beneficial results here and now.
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph-1-ipg">
		The prepared English texts intend to offer a literal word to word translation. Although they may present themselves as not as fluent and appealing as other possible translations, they suit the purpose of this collection of texts, which is to introduce the reader to the direct words of the Buddha.

		<li id="section1-note-1" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>1</sup> This collection would have never been realized without the wonderful work of the Pāli Text Society (PTS) and the Vipassana Research Institute (VRI) for putting the whole Pāli Tipimaka into digital and printed form and making it so easily available. It is impossible for me to express the boundless appreciation and indebtedness I nurture. The same gratitude is expressed towards all scholars. <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section1-note-1-rtn">↩</a></li>
		<li id="section1-note-2" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>2</sup>Although this selection of suttas tries to follow this intention under the described order that is presented in the English subtitles, of course it will always be the choice of the author. Although a guiding principle has been to collect suttas of special value for a Vipassana meditator, who may be interested to read them in their original, such as those he may have heard in discourses, some of the texts may not always fit under the respective chapters, but still will hopefully present an inspirational addition and helpful applicable support. <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section1-note-2-rtn">↩</a></li>
