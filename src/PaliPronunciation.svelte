		It seems not by pure chance that the words of the Buddha are maintained in the language of <a href="#section2-note-3" class="notes-ipg" id="section2-note-3-rtn"><span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span><sup class="sup-spacing-ipg">3</sup></a>, which in itself can be experienced as sweet and as deep as the Buddha’s words. The attempt to learn this ‘dead language’ will never present itself as a dry task. An archaeologist translating primitive paintings in a forgotten hallway of an ancient pyramid may transcend the barriers of time and to him these paintings may come alive. A practitioner of the path, reading the original words of the Buddha may delve into the past and create kinship with those ancient times. He will feel the Buddha’s words as if spoken to him and answers for long open questions. He may likewise appreciate that the beauty of this ancient language is enhanced by the profundity of contents:

	<p class="paragraph-1-ipg">
		The rules of combination of letters <span class="italic-w-ipg">(sandhi)</span> play an important role in the construction of words and sentences, it should be noted here that the most important reason for these is that <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> should never lose its typical melodious sound - harsh conjuncts are softened by assimilation, insertion, elision or substitution. Importance is given to the complete utterance rather than to individual words. The studyof the language in the context of sentences rather than words is encouraged; in this manner the approximate meaning of the word will enfold its precise and specific sense.

	<p class="paragraph-1-ipg">
		When pronouncing <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span>, proper care has to be given to the use of throat, mouth, the movement and touch of the tongue and lips, in order to produce the melodious, sonorous euphony that <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> requires. Special emphasis should be given to proper pronunciation and differentiation especially between retroflex and dentals, rather identical but different in <a href="#section2-note-7" class="notes-ipg" id="section2-note-7-rtn">sound.<sup class="sup-spacing-ipg">7</sup></a> An upright follower of the path, who undertakes to read and recite these suttas will meticulously perform this task if he uses proper and careful pronunciation, aspires to perfect understanding and remains deeply respectful and full of awareness <a href="#section2-note-8" class="notes-ipg" id="section2-note-8-rtn">within.<sup class="sup-spacing-ipg">8</sup></a>

		<li id="section2-note-3" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>3</sup> <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> here is taken as: <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli bhāsā</span> - the language of the texts. In this context it refers to the texts that are maintained in the Pāli Tipiṭaka and that present its value for the described intention of this collection. The question of the origin of the <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> language, its development from Maghādhī and or Prakrit, the Indio Arian languages and Sanskrit is left aside. <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section2-note-3-rtn">↩</a></li>
		<li id="section2-note-4" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>4</sup> The great lexicographer R.C. Childers quotes the ancient saying, that any child, left alone without hearing the human voice would instinctively speak Māgadhī (vernacular from which <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> assumingly derived). He also quotes the stanza, which expresses the assertion that Māgadhī was the original language of ancient times and which Brahmas, Sambuddhas and those who had never heard any speech would utter: <span class="italic-w-ipg">Sā Māgadhī mūlabhāsa narā yāyādikappikā, Brahmāna ca assutālāpā sambuddhā cāpi bhāsare</span>. <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section2-note-4-rtn">↩</a></li>
		<li id="section2-note-5" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>5</sup> R.C. Childers expresses his admiration towards the ‘at once flowing and sonorous’ sound of <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> that is reached by ‘most words ending in a vowel and the softening of harsh conjunctions by assimilation, elision or crasis.’ <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section2-note-5-rtn">↩</a></li>
		<li id="section2-note-6" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>6</sup> For example the <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli: namati:</span>  to bow down, to pay respect; <span class="italic-w-ipg">namo</span> : the reverence; is reflected in today’s languages: nomen; der Name, nennen; the name, to name, noun; el nombre; le nom; il nome etc.
Here it may be noted that a shift of meaning occurred from: the one being addressed with respect to the one being filled with identity. (See footnote 44.) <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section2-note-6-rtn">↩</a></li>
		<li id="section2-note-7" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>7</sup> These are the main principles that were maintained through the ages. Although the same recitations of <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> may sound different according to the national background and mother tongue of the person who recites the texts, with the spread and practice of <span class="italic-w-ipg">Pāli</span> through the world of today the main emphasis should be given to preserve these principles for the times to come. <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section2-note-7-rtn">↩</a></li>
		<li id="section2-note-8" class="footnotes-ipg"><sup>8</sup> Ideally a meditator before he starts reciting the suttas should get fully concentrated, keeping his awareness within on the level of sensations and esteeming the spoken words as personal guidance. <a class="backarrow-ipg" href="#section2-note-8-rtn">↩</a></li>
